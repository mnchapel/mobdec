# Description

MoBDec (pronounced as Moby Dick) - for Moving Objects Detection - is the code that I use for my research experimentations.
My current configuration on Linux:
- GCC 6.3
- OpenCV 3.3 with Opencv Contrib and CUDA 8.0.
- libldof_gpu.so from https://lmb.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/resources/binaries/, Dense Point Tracking part.

# Build - Linux
cd build
